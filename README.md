I made this because StreamControl fucking sucks ass and polls like stupid crazy.
To use this, run "npm install" to get your ass setup

What this does:
- Generates custom fields to be passed to an overlay using a WebSocket.
- Allows exporting of fields and importing them back

Roadmap:
- Better UI
- Ability to add categories for better labeling
- Formula fields

What I won't do:
- Make field groups with categories
